# 📊 Signal Tracker v3

This repository contains the full V3 version of a two-part system used for tracking global signals and mapping their economic and market impact.

---

## 🔧 Components

### 1. `signaltracker_v2.py`
- Extracts, scores, and classifies global events (economic, geopolitical, etc.)
- Processes both static and live test signals
- Writes outputs to `signals.xlsx` under:
  - `Primary`
  - `AllSignalsArchive`
  - `IndustryEngineInput`

### 2. `industryimpactengine_v2.py`
- Reads signals from `signals.xlsx`
- Matches classified events to regions using a custom mapping table
- Outputs the resulting tickers, sectors, and impact assessments to:
  - `ImpactResults_v1`

### 3. `signals.xlsx`
- Shared Excel file between both scripts
- Contains:
  - `ImpactMapping_v1` → used for signal-to-sector mapping
  - `SignalFeed_v2` → active input signals
  - All outputs generated by the system
